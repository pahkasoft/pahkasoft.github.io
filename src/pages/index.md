# PahkaSoft

I've open-sourced some of my projects and made them available here on this domain.

The name **PahkaSoft** was chosen a little bit with a wink in the eye.

> **Pahka** — *a natural wooden burl formed when a tree grows irregularly, creating dense, swirling grain patterns often prized for their unique beauty in woodworking.*  
>
> *It symbolizes **imperfection turned into strength and beauty**, a fitting metaphor for software that is **handcrafted, resilient, and organically complex.***  
>
> **Pronunciation:** /ˈpɑːkɑ sɒft/ — *PAH-kah-soft*
